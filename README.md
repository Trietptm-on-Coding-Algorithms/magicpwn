# MagicPWN

This repo contains a set of scripts and tools that I have collected and written while solving CTF challenges. I mostly focus on PWNing so they are the most useful at that.

## Huge Disclaimer

Most of this code was written during CTFs which makes the code quality and readability rather poor. I initially wanted to clean it a bit, but realised that I will probably never have the time for that so it is published as is.
